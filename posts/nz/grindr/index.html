Yeah, deffo not racist… Actually, let’s not even get started on this one, because there’s too much to say. If you’re interested, skip to <a href=#bonus-content-grindr-bingo>Grindr Bingo</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst many believe that a country reveals its true self in its treatment of its poorest or most in need, I’m of the opinion that one can tell an awful lot more about a country by the behaviour of its people in the throes of libidinous paroxysm.</p>
<p>Consequently, as a practising homosexual, I see no superior method for getting a real feel for the people and culture of New Zealand than through an examination of their presentation and interaction on Grindr. Please enjoy some interesting facts about the Kiwi people with illustrative screenshots.</p>
<h1 id=1-theyre-upfront-about-what-they-want-but-rarely-pushy>1. They’re upfront about what they want but rarely pushy</h1>
<figure><img src=images/1_piss.png>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Some shit is just worth draining your battery for.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, I feel like I need to make absolutely clear — in case it weren’t obvious from my responses (on the right) — that I neither forced this man (or any other for that matter) to drink my piss nor engaged in any kind of scatological role-play in which I pretended to force an essentially consenting adult to drink my piss while they feigned protest as part of a fun, sexy scenario.</p>
<p>This exchange is a real testament to the unwavering friendliness of the Kiwi, meeting even a rejection of their kind offer to be forced to drink someone else’s piss with pally bonhomie. Whilst British courtesy — the flurried staccato of “sorry” and “thank you” that dominates our day — serves largely to end involuntary social contact (preferably before it’s begun) the Kiwi is still well up for genial banter even if you decline the opportunity to force them to drink your piss.</p>
<p>So, of course this guy thanked me for my time after I turned down his offer to force him to drink my piss. Why wouldn’t he stop to wish me well after I declined his invitation to force him to drink my piss?
At the end of the day, what is a stranger who chooses not to force you to drink their piss but a friend who won’t force you to drink their piss whom you haven’t met yet?</p>
<h1 id=2-theyre-a-deeply-romantic-people-passionate-about-social-justice-and-the-arts>2. They’re a deeply romantic people, passionate about social justice and the arts</h1>

<p><em>Not a reference to mining. At least, not in any traditional sense.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one’s just for the lolz. Enjoy.</p>
<h1 id=3-they-dont-shy-away-from-the-tough-realities-of-the-agricultural-industry>3. They don’t shy away from the tough realities of the agricultural industry</h1>
<p><em>It’s the bio you want to focus on here.</em>
<figure><img src=images/3_agriculture.png>
</figure>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You had me at knife, hand, office work etc.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only knew one farmer in NZ, which doesn’t really sound like enough for a country with more sheep (and more cows) than humans, but, then again, I’ve lived in the UK almost my entire life and know barely any total xenophobes, which we have slightly more of than humans.</p>
<p>He showed us his fields, his cows and his milking apparatus (don’t…); he even let us try some unpasteurised milk, which made us feel very glamorous, like ladies in a magazine. He’s really sociable and loves music, card games and banter but struggles past KBT (Kiwi Bed Time) which is roughly 9pm* — Kiwis have really committed to agriculture, basing their sleep and social schedules around it. Whilst they’re super-friendly and will be inviting you out hunting, fishing or really any of the fun ways to murder animals amongst friends within days of your arrival, know that you’ll have plenty of Nextflix time after.</p>
<p>This is best demonstrated at pub quizzes, an activity which, in New Zealand, requires a comprehensive knowledge of the performance and history of national Rugbysport team, The All Blacks. Every quiz has at least one round which is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the All Blacks line-up in &lt;any year from 1970 to 1999>?
or:</li>
<li>Which All Black is scoring this try? &lt;video of amazing ass attached to some sports guy whom we’re expected to name for points>
Yeah, it’s a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing is, these have to be well over by KBT, at which point everyone bolts like there’s been a fire alarm. One time, a delay caused a quiz I attended to finish at 9.27pm* and the guy running it apologised four times. When it finished (at 9.27pm*), it was like the fucking Rapture. I lent forwards to dunk my chip in aïoli (NZ is all about the aïoli. I love aïoli) and sat back in an empty pub.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>*Time in NZ is always expressed using the 12-hour clock, even when it’s supremely awkward. Consequently, rosters are indecipherable, making it totally unclear when your coming or going and whether or not you will be required to travel backwards in time to complete your shift. One time I put 22:00 on a timesheet and everybody looked at me aghast like maybe I’d just daubed “C*NT” across it in hot, fresh jizz and menstrual blood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=4-theyre-cunning-linguists-who-know-well-the-pleasure-to-be-had-in-abbreviation>4. They’re cunning linguists who know well the pleasure to be had in abbreviation</h1>
<p><em>Even if it doesn’t reduce the number of syllables overall…</em>
<figure><img src=images/4_abbrv.png>
</figure>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Like, it takes just as long to say as blowjob. This does make it sounds more kid-friendly, but I don’t really see that as a good thing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kiwis talk funny, like real funny. They abbreviate very aggressively and cannot abide any word that could be substituted for a cutesier alternative, drawing instead from a rather adorable argot that is, in equal parts, ridiculous, incomprehensible and quite sweet really.</p>
<p>A prime example of this is their word for contactless payment: where we have gone with a long, clunkily articulated, Latinate word that emphasises the very British need not to touch or in any way communicate with anything or anyone, Kiwis have gone with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjJfIKZLdIM">payWave</a>. It’s cute, it’s friendly, it’s named after two things you might do to an overnight suitor before work — it’s so Kiwi.</p>
<p>For further examples of Kiwis' linguistic cutesyism please see the below paragraph and accompanying close rendering of the text in UK English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, nah. That sounds sweet as, but I don’t think I can get a blowie this arvo. I’ll have a squizz at my diary, but I haven’t got heaps of time, as I’m watching a doco with a mate. It’s all a bit sus, as this guy’s an egg and he’s yarning about hanging around outside the dairy in his gumboots and togs. Eh?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I’m about to begin a sentence</strong></em>: that sounds <em><strong>great</strong></em>, but I don’t think I can get a <em><strong>blowjob</strong></em> this <em><strong>afternoon</strong></em>. I’ll have a <em><strong>look</strong></em> at my diary, but I haven’t got <em><strong>much</strong></em> time, as I’m watching a <em><strong>documentary</strong></em> with a mate. It’s all a bit <em><strong>suspect/suspicious</strong></em>, as this guy’s a <em><strong>total fucker</strong></em> and he’s <em><strong>going on</strong></em> about hanging around outside the <em><strong>newsagent/convenience store</strong></em> in <em><strong>Wellington boots</strong></em> and <em><strong>swimwear</strong></em>. <em><strong>This is not a question (despite my misleading intonation); this story is, in fact, over</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=5-sometimes-they-just-want-a-couple-of-guys-to-come-over-shout-at-the-screen-piss-on-the-floor-and-set-the-kitchen-on-fire>5. Sometimes, they just want a couple of guys to come over, shout at the screen, piss on the floor and set the kitchen on fire</h1>
<figure><img src=images/5_sims.png>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Yes, indeed, picture of a boat, crossed out llama, umbrella? Friendship++</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fZM0u336Qw">MISHUNO</a>! Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoB_IeGTU_4&feature=youtu.be&t=16">this</a>.</p>
<p>Some people have shit spelling. ‘Nuff said.</p>
<h1 id=6-they-really-like-a-british-accent>6. They really like a British accent</h1>
<figure><img src=images/6_british.png>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Not an unusual enquiry</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may seem like a rather tame example, but that’s because the other options were beyond even my countenance, which is — as well you know — a fairly lax threshold and totally puerile domain at the best of times.</p>
<p>Trust me, the claims made by some Kiwi gentlemen about their typical route to — and the facility with which they could achieve — ejaculation with the assistance of Anglophone stimulation were astonishing, bizarre and beyond even my low bar for decency.</p>
<p>Needless to say I got serious bonus points for my accent, which fits the typical Kiwi perspective of Britain as something between Notting Hill (the film not the actual place) and a train set. With my already being on a pretty good 7/10 (aggregate score) without this elocutionary buff, it really is an insoluble mystery that I don’t have seven husbands, a lifestyle block* and a modest herd of dairy cattle by this point. Perhaps the Manic Pixie Dream Grant they were hoping for was a little more sardonic than they were expecting (see next screenshot).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>*A farm attached to your house run purely as a hobby. Yes, farming can be a hobby. As a nation, they’ve reached some consensus that the right time to get up in the morning is about five, so really you may as well do a spot of milking, if nothing else, for something to do.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=7-nevertheless-they-dont-100-get-british-sarcasm>7. Nevertheless they don’t 100% get British sarcasm</h1>
<figure><img src=images/7_sarcasm.png>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Zero response at all to what I’m pretty sure is top-notch banter, amirite ladies?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, my sarcastic retorts were largely unsuccessful in New Zealand. Now, that’s not to say that my usual method of seduction through a discombobulating cocktail of gallows humour, affected hubris and sesquipedalianism has been particularly effective on any continent, but it does serve to demonstrate that the supposed Kiwi love for the British sense of humour is mostly based on Shit Smuggler in Chief, Richard Curtis’s antipodes-accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giq7KdN4X-Y&feature=youtu.be&t=141">caricature</a> of our actually rather crappy and nihilistic little nation. My series of dark and self-deprecating yet awkwardly aggrandising non-sequiturs sadly did not fit this idealised view.</p>
<p>Yes, I am holding myself up as a prime example of Britishness here, a top sirloin cut of grain-fed, premium-bred, uncaged raw and sexy British beef, because I take the <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/michael-gove-british-values-curriculum>Michael Gove</a> view on British values that, fuck you, whatever I say goes. Sadly, I’ve never been in charge of the curriculum but were I ever given the opportunity, there’d be mandatory teaching of research methods, abstinence would be strictly prohibited and it would be illegal to intentionally promote heterosexuality or promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of heterosexuality as a pretended family relationship. I call it <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28>Section 69</a>.</p>
<h1 id=bonus-content-grindr-bingo>Bonus content: Grindr Bingo!</h1>
<p>Wherever you go in the world, here’s what to look out for. See if you can find a profile with all of them! Celebrate, let twitter know, then block them. You do not want to talk to that person.</p>
<ul>
<li>Racism</li>
<li>Other forms of discrimination or shaming (e.g. “no femmes/fats”)</li>
<li>Denial of racism/discrimination (bonus points for disguising it as ‘preference’)</li>
<li>Requirement to be discreet/DL</li>
<li>Misspelling discreet</li>
<li>Juxtaposition of apparent dismay that romance is dead with requests for ass, hole or cock</li>
<li>Picture of a torso (bonus points for accompanying with following bio “NO FACE NO CHAT”)</li>
<li>Straight acting — No-one knows what this really means, presumably just internalised homophobia. Doubt this principle applies to coitus…</li>
<li>“No ignorance/time-wasters” — A strange Grindrism born, I think, of insecurity; one is considered ignorant or a time-waster if one doesn’t respond instantly, every time, assuring the (usually faceless) interlocutor that they are the handsomest little boy in all of the class and that they shall have a gold star/anal.</li>
<li>“Say something more interesting than hey” — From experience, I can assure you this does not necessarily mean they want to discuss the existence of god.</li>
</ul>
